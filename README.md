This program (naive_bayes.py) implements a Naïve Bayes classifier to predict whether to play tennis based on weather conditions. It reads a training dataset (weather_training.csv) to compute prior and conditional probabilities, then applies these to classify instances from a test dataset (weather_test.csv). 
It outputs classifications with confidence scores, displaying only those with ≥ 0.75 confidence, rounded to 3 decimal places.
